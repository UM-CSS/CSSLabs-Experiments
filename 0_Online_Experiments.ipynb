    "## Section 1: Background\n",
    "\n",
    "The Music Lab experiment conducted by Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (SDW2006) studied the effects of social influence by observing the music listening behavior of participants.\n",
    "Participants were given a list of songs and allowed to download the ones they liked to listen to later (this was before music streaming was popular). The number of downloads can be a measure of the quality of a song, but it can also result in social influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment included a single **control** scenario where a group of participants were shown a set of **previously unknown songs from unknown bands** in an randomly ordered grid and were asked to listen, rate, and if they wanted to, download the songs. In order to measure the effect of social influence, the scientists created 8 separate scenarios (or worlds) where  **randomly assigned** participants were shown the number of times each song had been downloaded up to the point of observation. In fact, two versions of the experiment were conducted with different degrees of social influence. In the low-influence scenario, the participants were shown the songs in a grid identical to the control scenario except for the additionally showing the number of times each song was downloaded. In the  high-influence scenario participants were shown the songs in a single column in descending order of the number of downloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "The observations from the experiments were used to answer the two main questions: (1) How did social influence affect the popularity of the songs in comparison to the control scenario? and (2) How did social influence change the predictability of the popularity of songs in comparison to the control scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the notebook, we will replicate the analyses in the paper using the data from the experiments and interpret the findings.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Section 2: Setup\n",
    "### 2.1 Load Python Libraries\n",
    "We will use several python libraries that make it easier to analyze and plot data."

Below we consider a few example distributions with their corresponding Lorenz curves and Gini coefficients.

Imagine a version of the music lab experiment where we have the ability to erase the memory of the participants and have them repeat the experiment multiple times. In this setting, the order in which the participants come in and engage with the experiment can change from run to run. This, and other reasons, mean that the final download counts for a song across each iteration can change. This variation is the what we call the **unpredictability**. Let's consider a toy example with three runs of the experiment across a small number of songs."
