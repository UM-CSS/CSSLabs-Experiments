    "\n",
    "The Music Lab experiment conducted by Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (SDW2006) studied the effects of social influence by observing the music listening behavior of participants.\n",
    "Participants were given a list of songs and allowed to download the ones they liked to listen to later (this was before music streaming was popular). The number of downloads can be a measure of the quality of a song, but it can also result in social influence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The experiment included a single **control** scenario where a group of participants were shown a set of **previously unknown songs from unknown bands** in an randomly ordered grid and were asked to listen, rate, and if they wanted to, download the songs. In order to measure the effect of social influence, the scientists created 8 separate scenarios (or worlds) where  **randomly assigned** participants were shown the number of times each song had been downloaded up to the point of observation. In fact, two versions of the experiment were conducted with different degrees of social influence. In the low-influence scenario, the participants were shown the songs in a grid identical to the control scenario except for the additionally showing the number of times each song was downloaded. In the  high-influence scenario participants were shown the songs in a single column in descending order of the number of downloads. \n",
    "\n",
    "The observations from the experiments were used to answer the two main questions: (1) How did social influence affect the popularity of the songs in comparison to the control scenario? and (2) How did social influence change the predictability of the popularity of songs in comparison to the control scenario?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the rest of the notebook, we will replicate the analyses in the paper using the data from the experiments and interpret the findings.\n",

    "Now that you've reproduced the analysis from (SDW2006), it's your turn! You will be running your own online experiment to measure the effects of social influence. Before starting an experiment, it's important to think about how many participants you will need in order to find what you're looking for. This is called power analysis. The smaller the effect you're trying to find, the more participants you will need.\n",

In this case, not very many participants are necessary to see the unpredictability effect, but we have calculated that at least 900 participants in each world are necessary to observe an effect on inequality. In experiment 2, the songs were shown in a list, creating a strong social influence effect. In this case, only 450 participants are necessary in each world.\n",
