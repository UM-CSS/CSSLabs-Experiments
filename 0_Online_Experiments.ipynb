    "The Music Lab experiment conducted by Salganik, Dodds, and Watts (SDW2006) studied the effects of social influence by observing the music listening behavior of participants.\n",
    "Participants were given a list of songs and allowed to download the ones they liked to listen to later (this was before music streaming was popular).\n",
    "The number of downloads can be a measure of the quality of a song, but it can also result in social influence.\n",
    "If participants can see how many others downloaded a song before them, it may influence their decision to listen to or to download that song.\n",
    "This notebook reproduces their results using their actual data and allows you to design and analyze your own social influence experiment.\n",
