# CSSLabs: Social Influence in a Cultural Market
This lab allows you to conduct an online experiment to study social influence,
based on [1] and [2].
The experiment uses the oTree online experimentation software,
and the analysis uses python in a jupyter notebook.
You can also use this lab to re-analyze the data from the original study [1].

## Experiment
To run the experiment, follow the instructions
[cultural_markets/Readme.md](here) to install and run the `cultural_markets`
module for oTree.

## Analysis
### Requirements

* python3
* numpy
* scipy
* pandas

This lab also uses the Cultural Market data set available at [http://opr.princeton.edu/archive/cm/].
The data files should be downloaded and decompressed into the `external` directory.
